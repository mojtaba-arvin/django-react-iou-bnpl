A full-stack **Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)** system based on an **I.O.U-based installment loan model**, built with **Django** and **React.js**.

It follows a **Private/Assigned Plan** structure, where merchants assign installment plans to specific customers. The system is also designed to support **Public Plans** in the future, allowing broader plan accessibility beyond individual assignments.

## üîç Backend Features

### Architecture & Code Design:
- **Separated view and service logic** ‚Äì Follows clean architecture principles, aiding in maintainability and testing.
- **DRF-compatible Standardized API response mixin** ‚Äì Provides uniform success/error response formats, improving client integration and Swagger docs clarity.	
- **Custom DRF exception handler** ‚Äì Standardizes error responses, making debugging and frontend handling more consistent.	
- **Base business exception class** ‚Äì Centralizes business logic exceptions, enabling more structured error handling.
- **Unified paginated list responses** ‚Äì Ensures consistent pagination output, reducing frontend complexity.	
- **Modular Django settings (development/production)** ‚Äì Simplifies environment-based configuration management with proper type casting.	

### Authentication & Permissions
- **Reject tokens if user is inactive** ‚Äì Enhances security by invalidating access even with a valid token.	
- **Custom JWT for skipping expired tokens on public endpoints** ‚Äì Allows anonymous access without breaking flow, improving public endpoint UX.	
- **Custom DRF permission classes** ‚Äì Improves UX by showing specific access error messages.	
- **Object-level permission view mixin** ‚Äì Provides auto-checks in viewsets with reusable logic

### Tooling
- **Structured logging with JSON format (structlog)** ‚Äì Supports modern observability tools like ELK or Datadog.	
- **FactoryBoy + DRF APITestCase** ‚Äì Allows fast, isolated, and reusable tests, boosting test coverage and quality.	
- **PEP8, typing, and Google docstrings** ‚Äì Increases code readability, maintainability, and quality.

### API Documentation
- **Swagger schema utilities for response documentation** ‚Äì Improves API clarity and keeps documentation aligned with real behavior.	

### CI/CD & Test Automation
- **Prebuilt Docker image for backend CI** ‚Äì Reduces CI time by skipping local build and using cached layers.	
- **GitHub workflow: backend tests with concurrency rules** ‚Äì Smart test runs based on event type, skipping unnecessary builds.	
- **Test artifacts: logs and coverage reports** ‚Äì Enhances CI transparency and developer feedback loops.	

### Installments & Plans Logic
- **Bulk create installments via thread-local flag for signal** ‚Äì Optimizes mass insert operations and automates setup logic.	
- **Signal for updating installment plan status** ‚Äì Keeps data integrity by reflecting changes in related models.
- **Installment conflict prevention checks** ‚Äì Prevents logic bugs like double payments or out-of-sequence transactions.
- **Conditional UniqueConstraint and CheckConstraint** ‚Äì Enforces business rules at the DB level, protecting data consistency for unique installment sequence and due date per plan with correct amount

### Background Tasks (Celery)
- **Celery tasks for reminders and overdue checks** ‚Äì Adds scalability by offloading background operations.	
- **Separated Celery workers as Docker services** - helps decouple task processing from the main API which improves maintainability, scalability, and fault tolerance of the system.

### User Management
- **Signals for customer/merchant profile creation** ‚Äì Automates related object creation, ensuring consistency.	
- **Auto approve merchants and customer credits in debug mode** ‚Äì Speeds up development/testing by bypassing manual checks.
- **DRF-based unique email validation + Django password validation** ‚Äì Ensures secure user creation.	
- **Custom UserManager + Support the Group and Permission models** ‚Äì Enables extensible user creation logic and permission handling.

### DB Models
- **Abstract base model to add timestamps with indexed created_at** ‚Äì Improves database efficiency for ordering/filtering operations.	
- **Future-proof database design with abstracted plan-customer relation** ‚Äì The system avoids directly linking `Plan -> Customer` to enable future support for Public Plans. Instead, it introduces an intermediate `InstallmentPlan` that connects a `Plan` (owned by a merchant)
to a `User` (the customer), providing flexibility for both assigned and publicly available plans.

## Getting started (Development)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Step 1: Copy `.env` file to configre

Create a .env file by copying the example configuration:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è To development set correct file permissions with UID/GID (Optional but recommended):
The containers run using the same **user ID (UID)** and **group ID (GID)** as your host machine, defined via `HOST_UID` and `HOST_GID` in the `.env` file.
This prevents permission issues when writing files (e.g., migrations, logs) from within containers to your local file system.

**Note:** If you're using **Linux** and your UID and GID are both **1000**, which is common for the first local user, you can skip this step ‚Äî the default values will work just fine.

If you're unsure, you can find your host UID and GID by running:
```bash
id -u && id -g
```

### Step 2: Start required services

Use the following command to start **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and the **API service**:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d bnpl-db bnpl-redis bnpl-api
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Healthchecks Note:
Services will only start once their dependencies are marked as healthy.
- **PostgreSQL** has a `pg_isready` check.
- **Redis** uses `redis-cli ping`.

This may <u>take a few seconds</u> depending on your system.


### Step 3: Enter the API container

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec bnpl-api /bin/sh
```

### Step 4: Apply migrations and run the Django development server

Once inside the container, run the following commands to initialize the database:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
This applies any outstanding database migrations. 

If you may also want to use the Django `admin` dashboard feature, you need to create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Afterward, start the Django development server. It binds to `0.0.0.0`, making it accessible from outside the container:

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Note:** You only need to run `migrate` the first time or whenever new migrations are added to the project.

### Step 5 (Optional): Start Celery background workers as separate Docker services
The project uses **Celery** to handle asynchronous tasks such as background processing and scheduled jobs.
Running Celery as separate services helps **decouple task processing from the main API**, which improves maintainability, scalability, and fault tolerance of the system.

Start both the **worker** and **beat** services using the following command:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d bnpl-worker bnpl-beat
```

### Step 6: Explore API endpoints via Swagger UI

### Swagger UI
Once the development server is running, you can browse and try all available API endpoints using Swagger UI:

Open: http://localhost:8000/swagger/

### API endpoints

#### Authentication
`POST /api/auth/register/` ‚Äî Register a new user (as Customer or Merchant)

`POST /api/auth/token/` ‚Äî Obtain access and refresh JWT tokens

`POST /api/auth/token/refresh/` ‚Äî Refresh your access token using a refresh token

---
####  Customers
`GET /api/customers/eligible/` ‚Äî List eligible customers (merchant-only access), useful when assigning customer IDs during private plan creation
 
**Eligible customers definition:**
 - The customer's profile must be **active**, meaning they are allowed to use BNPL services
 - The customer's credit score status must be set to **approved**

---

#### Installments and Plans

`GET /api/installments/` ‚Äî list installments with filtering upcoming/past (owner customer-only access)

`POST /api/installments/{id}/pay/` ‚Äî Pay for a specific installment (owner customer-only access)

`POST /api/plans/` ‚Äî Create a new installment plan (verified merchant-only access)

 **Features:**
- Installments are created in `bulk`, improving performance and scalability.
- A thread-local flag is used to skip signal-based creation, preventing redundant processing during batch operations.

`GET /api/plans/` ‚Äî List all existing installment plans for both customers and merchants access

**Customer view:**

- Lists only installment plans associated to the customer.

**Merchant view:**

- Lists only installment plans created by the current merchant.
- includes customer_email field

`GET /api/plans/{id}/` ‚Äî retrieve the details of a specific installment plan with object-level access for customers and merchants

---

#### Analytics
`GET /api/analytics/dashboard/` ‚Äî Overview of key business metrics (merchant-only access)

- includes total revenue, success rate, total overdue and total active_plans

---

### Admin panel (useful during development)
If you created a superuser, you can access the Django admin interface at:

http://localhost:8000/admin/

- User model includes **inline editing** for CustomerProfile and MerchantProfile.
- Show **clickable links** to the related Plan and Customer (User), for fast navigation and context.
